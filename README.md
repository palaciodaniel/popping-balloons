# Popping Balloons!

A simple guessing game, which also was the first "project" I created. It was originally released on April 2019 on my [Sololearn's profile](https://www.sololearn.com/Profile/13506786) and it took me only one hour to write it, after learning the contents from a Sololearn's Python lesson. 

The goal is very simple: guess the color of the last balloon. 

However, achieving it won't be that simple...

## Instructions

The easiest way to play it is by simply following [this link](https://code.sololearn.com/cYzhcWr468NS/#py).

You'll be expected to input a color, from a list of six. Good luck!
