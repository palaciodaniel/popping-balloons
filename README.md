# Popping Balloons!

A simple guessing game, which also was the first "project" I created. It was released on April 2019 and it took me only one hour to finish (I was applying the contents from a Sololearn's Python lesson). 

The goal is very simple: guess the color of the last balloon. However, predicting it won't be that simple...

## Instructions

The easiest way to load it is to simply look for any online Python shell and then copy the contents of the .py file there.

You'll be expected to input a color, from a list of six. Good luck!
